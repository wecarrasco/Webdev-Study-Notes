# Stoicism

Stoicism is a practical branch of philosophy (seems like an oxymoron, but it isn't) focused on finding a better way to live one's everyday life.

## Don't Let Emotions Rule

* Don't be a slave to wild, irrational passions.

## Take Only What You Need

* Minimalist life to avoid too much attachment, since each attachment takes away from one's control.

## Accepting a Lack of Control

* See how small we are relative to the rest
* We can't control much of what happens to us, but we can control our reactions to it
  * Can't always control our emotions, but we can let them pass by with simple acknowledgement and not letting them pull us down
  * Can't always control our rushing thoughts, but we can let the thoughts exist simply and not follow them where they want to take us.
  * See these thoughts and emotions like passing clouds that will soon pass.
* Can come to see all situations as more positive, seeing the good we can take from them and making use of them. Traffic jam example?

## Nothing is Permanent

* All our problems are temporary and will fade, and aren't deserving of great stress
* All our achievements are also temporary, so we shouldn't sit on our laurels or rely on them too much for a sense of self

## Don't Avoid Misfortune

* Imagine worst-case scenarios
* Voluntary discomfort
* Become more grateful for the simple things you have now

## Don't Fear Death

* Death is the end of all feeling, so it's neither good nor bad.
* We have no control over the fact that we die, so too much stress or anguish over it is pointless
* Remembering our mortality can still spur us into more action when needed. Done right is a motivator
